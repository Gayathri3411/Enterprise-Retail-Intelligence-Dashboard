### 🧠 How It Works

This table is generated through a DAX expression like:

- DAX
Customer Metrics Selection = {
    ("Total Customers", NAMEOF('Measure Table'[Total Customers]), 0),
    ("Revenue per Customer", NAMEOF('Measure Table'[Revenue per Customer]), 1)
}

## 💲 Price Adjustment Percentage (What-If Parameter Table)

The **Price Adjustment Percentage** table is a DAX-generated *what-if parameter* that allows users to simulate changes in product pricing.  
Using this parameter, the dashboard can dynamically recalculate revenue, profit, and margin under different pricing scenarios.

This enables powerful business use cases such as discount impact analysis and price sensitivity modeling.
